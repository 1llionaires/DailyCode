// An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.

// Example:

// The starting array sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
// The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]
// Your function should return the int 5.
// If no number was deleted from the array and no difference with it, your function should return the int 0.

// Note: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be []).

//return the missing number in the second array and if there are none return 0
//create a function and use a boolean to check if array lengths are equal
//if equal return 0 else reduce both arrays and subtract for the difference and that will be the missing number
